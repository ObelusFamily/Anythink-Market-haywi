# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

To make the system work locally on the first time:
1. Download Docker
2. Run `docker compose up`
3. Wait a minute or two for things to download and install (only on the first time) and then  http://localhost:3000 (backend) and  http://localhost:3001 (frontend) should work
